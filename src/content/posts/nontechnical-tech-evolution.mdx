NonTechnical tech has gone through many changes in technology and style.

This website was the first real website I ever made and I used my new and first computer. It was also the first website I ever made with <Tag name="vue"/>.

## Phase 1, Vue Options Api

> Vue 3, options API, Webpack, self-made CSS, publicly served markdown and JSON data

My first time using Vue, node and all the bells and whistles that come with development from a computer came with many struggles. The opinion API was pretty easy to use. The properties were self-explanatory and sped up development far faster than regular vanilla JS. Reaching the end, after struggling through many router issues and determining the best way to fetch the markdown, I had an okay-looking website that worked for what I had in mind.

## Phase 2, Hosting Markdown and Data on Supabase

> Vue 3, options API, Webpack, self-made CSS, Supabase served markdown and JSON data

Then, I wanted to be able to update my articles and projects and was learning a bit about CMS. I looked for free CMSs that allow you to serve raw markdown and JSON data, but I could not find any. At this time, I was also looking into Subabase and discovered that it has a storage API. So, I decided to use Supabase, meant for authentication and storing user data, to host my markdown files and JSON data. I also added my project page, latest project and search page to the website. It was beginning to look like something that I had envisioned. I spent some more time fixing styles and bugs, then phase 2 was complete.

## Phase 3, Composition API

> Vue 3, composition API, Vite, self-made CSS, Supabase served markdown and JSON data

I began to learn the composition API and kind of enjoyed it. To understand it better, I decided to rewrite all the components of my website to use the composition API instead of the options. Using `Ref`s was probably the hardest thing to get used to. The code was pretty easy to rewrite and looked far more readable than before. I also changed the Supabase hosting slightly to make it easier, switched to using Vite to bundle the code and fixed many CSS bugs.

## Phase 4, Nuxt JS

> Nuxt, composition API, typescript, Vite, Primevue, Nuxt Content

And now to the phase I am currently designing as I write this article. Phase 4 is all about improving the feel of the website. Markdown is loaded for the article before finishing the navigation. This removed the loading that was a turn-off to look at while the markdown was being fetched in phase 3. The styling of the website now uses Primevue to give it a much more professional look. Markdown and JSON data are hosted with Nuxt Content to make a faster load time and make it easier for me to update information. SEO should greatly improve because of the APIs Nuxt provides. I have these goals for phase 4 and hope they are fulfilled.

## Phase 5, Astro

> Astro, typescript, pico.css

Almost eight months later and I have changed the website again (will this ever end?). This phase was about simplicity. I wanted to learn some Astro, so I thought I would try to rewrite this website using it. Astro made things so easy with the routing and article fetching. The outcome was so less bloated that I thought I would keep this new technology. I also changed the name to reflect a portfolio more. Additionally, I used [pico.css](https://v2.picocss.com/docs) because I suck at styling and it provides all I need with minimum fluff. An extra benefit of using Astro was that I could serve the website on GitHub pages because Astro outputs static files, leaving me another free site to host on Vercel.
