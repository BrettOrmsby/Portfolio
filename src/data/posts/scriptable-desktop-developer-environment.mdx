Although the Scriptable text editor is exceptionally designed for mobile use, it doesn't scale well to desktop computers. While the app works great for on-the-go development, I prefer using a computer at home to boost my productivity. Luckily, setting up a work environment on Mac computers is not too difficult.

## JavaScript Work Environment

Before we get started, you should download the Mac-compatible app for Scriptable, which can be found at the [archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230615065558/https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/). We will code scripts in our favourite text editors and run them with the Mac app. Sadly, the Mac app does not support accessory widgets, so it cannot be used for all purposes.

### Getting Started

Start by creating a folder for the environment and navigating to it in the terminal. We'll make the folder called `scriptable-environment`.

```bash
mkdir scriptable-environment
cd scriptable-environment
```

Then, we will create a basic `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Which will produce something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "scriptable-environment",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

### Adding Autocomplete

Next, we'll make a `jsconfig.json` file. The `lib` property defines what version of JavaScript is being used. The `moduleDetection` property ensures that no files are treated as global, so scripts should not affect each other.
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "moduleDetection": "force",
  }
}
```

To set up autocomplete, we will install some types using the `scriptable-ios` package. If you are using VSCode, you can also hover over your code, like a `Request`, and a small description and link to the documentation will appear. The `jsconfig.json` that we made previously also helps to set the Scriptable `Request` and `Image` types to take priority over native types.

```bash
npm install @types/scriptable-ios -D
```

### Linking to Scriptable

The final step is to create a symlink from the Scriptable documents to the `src` folder. You should not have made a `src` folder before running the command to generate the link.

```bash
ln -s ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud~dk~simonbs~Scriptable/Documents src
```

> Note: one way to find the path of files on Mac is to drag a file to the terminal and see the result. This was how we found the path to the Scriptable scripts.

Now, whenever you make changes in your text editor, the changes are synced to the Scriptable scripts. The final project structure should be:

```plaintext
scriptable-environment/
├── node_modules/
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   └── ... 
├── jsconfig.json
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

### Bonus: Running Scripts from the Command Line

Often in development setups, you can run something like `npm run dev` to start a program. We can make something similar to run our Scriptable scripts.

First, we will create a folder called `scripts` at the root of our project. Then create a file called `runScript.js`. Before we make the script, we need to install the `open` package, which allows us to open links. Scriptable provides a URL to run scripts similar to `scriptable:///run/script-name`. Hence, we can use the `open` package to run our Scriptable scripts from the command line.

```bash
npm install open -D
```

The `runScript.js` script is straightforward. We grab the first argument passed to the script, remove the file extension, encode the file name, and then try to run the script.

```js
import open from "open";
const args = process.argv;
if (args.length >= 3) {
  const script = args[2];
  const scriptName = script.replace(/\.js$/, "");
  await open("scriptable:///run/" + encodeURIComponent(scriptName));
} else {
  console.error("A Scriptable script must be provided as an argument.");
}
```

Now, we can update the `package.json` with some script shortcuts. We'll also specify `type: "module"` to avoid console warnings.

```json
{
  ...
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "script": "node scripts/runScript.js \"script-name.js\"",
    "s": "node scripts/runScript.js"
  },
  ...
}
```

You can name the script shortcuts however you like or update them to your needs. The first option, `npm run script`, will run a specific script. If you are primarily focused on one script, you can change the name in the command to always run that script. The second option, `npm run s script-name.js`, allows you to run any script you pass in as the argument. It is more useful if you plan on developing multiple scripts at the same time.

### Limitations

If you have the Mac Scriptable app and this developer environment setup, whenever you change your scripts, before running the Scriptable script to see the changes, you will have to exit the script text editor and enter it again. Otherwise, the script would run without the updates. Additionally, if you are using the `runScript.js` method to open Scriptable and run a script, it only runs on the main screen, so you cannot see the console outputs.
> Interestingly, I have found that if you edit a script used in another via `importModule`, you can stay in the other script's text editor view. Then, whenever it is run, the updated code will be imported.

## TypeScript Work Environment

Many of the steps to set up a TypeScript work environment will be similar to the JavaScript environment. Once again, if you haven't downloaded the Mac-compatible Scriptable app, you can find it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230615065558/https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/).

### Getting Started

Start by creating a folder for the environment and navigating to it in the terminal. We'll make the folder called `scriptable-ts-environment`.

```bash
mkdir scriptable-ts-environment
cd scriptable-ts-environment
```

Then, we will create a basic `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Which will produce something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "scriptable-environment",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

### Configuring TypeScript

Now, we will install TypeScript and Scriptable types:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript
npm install --save-dev @types/scriptable-ios
```

Next, we will create a `tsconfig.json` file. We set `module` and `moduleResolution` to `Node16`, which is not too important considering we can't use normal imports in Scriptable. However, the purpose of this is to allow top-level awaits. The `moduleDetection` property ensures that no files are treated as global, so scripts should not affect each other. The `target` is a more recent version of JavaScript, which Scriptable supports. We set `sourceMap` to `false` because we only want the singular JavaScript files compiled. We have yet to set up our `roodDir` or `outDir`, but those tell TypeScript what code we are editing and where to output our JavaScript files. Finally, the `types` and `lib` properties work together to ensure the Scriptable types, such as `Result` and `Image`, take priority over the native types. 

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "Node16",
    "moduleResolution": "node16",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "target": "es2022",
    "sourceMap": false,
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "scriptable",
    "types": ["scriptable-ios"],
    "lib": ["es2022"]
  }
}
```

We also need to update the `package.json` to allow top-level awaits with the `type: "module"` option:

```json
{
  ...
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

### Linking to Scriptable

The TypeScript scripts we make will be in the `src` folder. So we can create the directory:

```bash
mkdir src
```

Now, we need to create a symlink to the Scriptable folder so that TypeScript can output the JavaScript files directly to the Scriptable folder. After running the following command, you should see a `scriptable` folder was created which connects to all your scripts.

```bash
ln -s ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud~dk~simonbs~Scriptable/Documents scriptable
```
Now, you can make a test script in TypeScript under the `src` directory.

### Compiling TypeScript

Let's update the `package.json` with a script to compile the TypeScript:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsc"
  },
  ...
}
```

Now we can run `npm run dev` to compile the TypeScript. But there is a problem. If you have a test script in the `src` directory, then compile the TypeScript. Afterwards, open the script in the Scriptable Mac App to see the changes. You will notice that `export {};` was added to the end of the file. If you run the script, it will cause an error. Thus, we need to create a script to strip this line after compiling the TypeScript.

Start by creating a `scripts` directory:

```bash
mkdir scripts
```

Then, we will make a JavaScript file called `stripExports.js`. In this script, we will get all the file names from the `src` directory, filter out those not in TypeScript, and then map them to a `Promise` that strips the exports. In this async function, we check if the TypeScript file exists as a JavaScript file in the `scriptable` directory. Then, we read the file, remove the export, and write the updated file.

```js
import { readdir, readFile, writeFile, access } from "fs/promises";
import path from "path";

const srcDir = "./src";
const scriptableDir = "./scriptable";

async function stripExports() {
  const files = await readdir(srcDir);

  const tasks = files
    .filter((file) => file.endsWith(".ts"))
    .map(async (file) => {
      const jsFile = file.replace(/\.ts$/, ".js");
      const scriptableFile = path.join(scriptableDir, jsFile);

      try {
        await access(scriptableFile); // Check if file exists
        const code = await readFile(scriptableFile, "utf8");
        const stripped = code.replace(/export {};\s*$/, "\n");
        await writeFile(scriptableFile, stripped);
      } catch (err) {
        console.warn(`Skipping ${scriptableFile}: ${err.message}`);
      }
    });

  await Promise.all(tasks);
}

stripExports();
```

We still need to update the `package.json` to strip the exports when we compile the TypeScript:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsc && node scripts/stripExports.js"
  },
  ...
}
```

Finally, the TypeScript works as expected. Our file project structure should look like this:

```plaintext
scriptable-ts-environment/
├── node_modules/
│   └── ...
├── scriptable/
│   └── ...
├── scripts/
│   └── stripExports.js
├── src/
│   └── ...
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### Bonus: Running Scripts from the Command Line

Like in the JavaScript environment, we can run our Scriptable scripts from the command line.

We'll start by creating a file called `runScript.js` in the `scripts` directory. Before we make the script, we need to install the `open` package, which allows us to open links. Scriptable provides a URL to run scripts similar to `scriptable:///run/script-name`. Hence, we can use the `open` package to run our Scriptable scripts from the command line.

```bash
npm install open -D
```

The `runScript.js` script is straightforward. We grab the first argument passed to the script, remove the file extension, encode the file name, and then try to run the script.

```js
import open from "open";
const args = process.argv;
if (args.length >= 3) {
  const script = args[2];
  const scriptName = script.replace(/\.js$/, "");
  await open("scriptable:///run/" + encodeURIComponent(scriptName));
} else {
  console.error("A Scriptable script must be provided as an argument.");
}
```

Now, we can update the `package.json` with a script shortcut. Unlike in the JavaScript environment, we need to compile the TypeScript before running and strip the exports. When we do this, the Scriptable app will not notice the changes right away, so we add a `sleep 0.5` command before running the script.

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "script": "tsc && node scripts/stripExports.js && sleep 0.5 && node scripts/runScript.js \"test.js\""
    },
    ...
}
```

In this example, whenever we run the `npm run script` command, we run the `test.js` Scriptable script.

### Limitations

The limitations are mostly the same as in the JavaScript environment. If you have the Mac Scriptable app and this developer environment setup, whenever you change your scripts, before running the Scriptable script to see the changes, you will have to exit the script text editor and enter it again. Otherwise, the script would run without the updates. Additionally, if you are using the `runScript.js` method to open Scriptable and run a script, it only runs on the main screen, so you cannot see the console outputs. Finally, if you start a new TypeScript file and compile it multiple times, you will notice that the colour (and possibly icon) of the script changes. We can set the icon and colour with a few comments at the top of the TypeScript file. For example, you can go to the `scriptable` directory and enter one of your scripts and should see something like:

```js
// Variables used by Scriptable.
// These must be at the very top of the file. Do not edit.
// icon-color: red; icon-glyph: file-download;
```

## Conclusion

Now you can use a desktop environment to create Scriptable Scripts in JavaScript or TypeScript and still run them on your computer. I hope this will help in your Scriptable endeavours!
